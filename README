Welcome to the DayZ Whitelister Pro App by Hambeast aka deadfred666.

You can use this code however you like for the current time.  I just ask if you use it put a link here somewhere in your readme.  

Also if you like this program and want to buy me a beer, paypal donations are accepted at john@teqsun.com


To install, run all of the scripts in the SQL directory with your dayz user starting with "setupdb.sql"
then run the stored proc sql files to insert them into your db.

configure the db.php in src/php/whitelistadmin/include

configure the program.cs database info in C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\DayzWhitelisterPro\src\c#\DayzWhitelisterPro\DayzWhitelisterPro\

build the C# and run, your database should now be populated

to install the admin control panel, you will need to copy your src/php/whitelistadmin folder to somewhere in your webroot.  Note this app offers no security other than parameterized queries, so you must protect this location yourself.  I suggest using .htdocs but if you want to whip up a little login script that will work too.  Just remember not to expose this to the public.
