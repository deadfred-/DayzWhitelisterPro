Welcome to the DayZ Whitelister Pro App by Hambeast aka deadfred666.

You can use this code however you like for the current time.  I just ask if you use it put a link here somewhere in your readme.  Also if you want to buy me a beer, paypal donations are accepted at john@teqsun.com


To install, run all of the scripts in the SQL directory with your dayz user starting with "setupdb.sql"
then run the stored proc sql files to insert them into your db.

configure the db.php in src/php/whitelistadmin/include

configure the program.cs database info in C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\DayzWhitelisterPro\src\c#\DayzWhitelisterPro\DayzWhitelisterPro\

build the C# and run, your database should now be populated
